  "He calls for the guard clown, and has him escort you back to the midway. You end up facedown in the dirt next to the stage entrance.": "他召唤小丑保镖过来，吩咐对方把你押送回游乐场。你被大头朝下丢回了舞台入口外。",
  "You wake up some time later, thoroughly bruised and battered. You've been dumped in a heap outside the circus, next to your horse. I guess it's pretty lucky that you woke up at all; Barnaby Bob must either really like you, or hold you in such contempt that he doesn't think you're even worth the trouble of murdering. No prizes for guessing which is true.": "一段时间之后你醒了过来，浑身青一块紫一块的。你被丢出了马戏团外，在你的马旁边的垃圾堆里。你没死可真是命大；巴纳比·鲍勃要么是特别喜欢你，或者嫌杀你太浪费时间。反正猜对了也没奖励。",
  "And speaking of 'no prizes', it looks like he's taken back the coupon for a year's supply of dynamite that he gave you. Rats.": "说到“奖励”，这家伙好像把他给你的一年份炸药优惠券给拿回去了。真卑鄙！",
  "You take a seat, and a smattering of other patrons appear and sit down as well. After a minute or two, there's a crash of cymbals and a clown runs in from the backstage curtain and jumps up onto the stage.": "你找了个位置坐下，其他观众也渐渐坐满。几分钟后只听一声钹响，有个小丑从幕布后面连跑带跳到了台前。",
  "In contrast to the other clowns' colorful clothing, his is relatively simple -- black wool trousers, and a bright crimson shirt under a pale tan leather jacket with fringe on the sleeves and a red heart painted on the shoulder. His facepaint is plain white without any colored accents, contrasting his curled black mustache and thin goatee. A snappy silk top-hat with a rakish tilt tops off his outfit.": "与其他小丑五颜六色的衣服不同，他的着装十分简单——黑色羊毛裤子和一件浅红色衬衫，搭着一件浅棕色皮夹克，袖子上有条纹，肩上涂着一颗红心。他的脸上涂的是纯白色，和卷曲的八字胡还有稀疏的山羊胡形成鲜明对比。一顶漂亮的丝绸礼帽搭配这身不羁的着装，简直浑然天成。",
  "He doffs his hat and bows with a deep theatrical flourish, and the small audience claps politely.": "他摘下礼帽，向观众深深鞠了一躬。",
  "Clap": "鼓掌",

  "With a laugh, he flips a large bowie knife into the air -- you didn't even see where he pulled it from. The knife glitters as it spins; he catches it and flips it in the air again, this time catching and balancing it on its point, on the tip of one finger. He holds that pose very still for a moment, then jerks his hand out of the way -- the knife <i>thunks</i> into the wood of the stage floor, deep enough that he has to give it a jerk from side to side before he can yank the blade free. He winks broadly to the audience.": "他大笑一声，将一把巨大的刀子丢向空中——你甚至没看到他是从哪里将它拔出来的。刀子在空中旋转，闪闪发光；他接住之后又将它丢向空中，这次则是用指尖将其稳稳接住。他保持这个姿势一小会儿之后猛地将手抽出——刀子<b><color=red>咔嚓</color></b>一下深深扎在地板上，他使劲一拔才把刀子又拔了出来。这时他对观众眨眨眼。",
  "Wouldn't be any fun if they weren't <i>sharp</i>, would it ladies and gents?": "不是<b><color=red>快刀</color></b>的话就不好玩了，大家说对不对？",
  "He pulls two more knives from his jacket and begins a flashy and elaborate knife-juggling act. Three spinning blades somehow turn into four, and then his hat is added into the mix -- floating lightly through the cascade of knives without a single scratch.": "他从衣服里又掏出两把匕首，玩起了惊险刺激的丢刀子把戏。不知何时空中的小刀由三变四，紧接着他的帽子也加入其中——在刀光中翩然起舞，却没有一丝划痕。",
  "He finishes the routine by catching two of the knives in each hand and allowing his hat to fall nearly to the ground -- before catching it on the tip of his boot and kicking it back into the air and onto the top of his head.": "表演临近结束时，他一手抓住两把匕首，任由自己的帽子向着地面坠落——然后在其落地之际靴尖一挑，帽子又飞回了他的脑袋上。",
  "Ahh, now there's some applause I believe I've earned! Let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, it took a lot of hats to get to where I am today!": "哎呀呀，我就不推辞各位的掌声了！女士们先生们，我可是损失了好多帽子才练到这种程度呢！",
  "He chuckles as he adjusts his hat back to its original rakish tilt.": "他笑了笑，把帽子摆正。",
  "Now for the Grand Finale! For this I'll need a volunteer from the audience...": "接下来就该今晚的盛大谢幕了！我打算从观众里挑一名志愿者……",

  "Press your back flat up against the wood, please, and put your hands through the holes.": "请将后背贴紧木板，并把双手穿过木板上的洞口。",
  "You do so. The holes are just a fraction too high, so it's not very comfortable. And then one of the clowns pulls your arms back tighter and ties them together with rough hemp, so it becomes much more uncomfortable, for a variety of reasons.": "你照着做了，但是洞口有点高，让你不太舒服。紧接着某个小丑用一条粗麻绳固定好你的双臂，这样就更不舒服了。",
  "Don't worry! This is just to make sure you don't make any sudden and unexpected movements. We wouldn't want that... would we?": "不用担心！这只是确保你不会有一些下意识的反应。我们可不想误伤你……对吧？",

  "...<i>My</i> control. You know, @firstname@, we get a sharp customer through here from time to time, but my my, you're the sharpest I've seen yet!

  "His pupils narrow to vertical slits as he grins at you, revealing rows of pointed yellow shark teeth. As he turns away, you can see that the heart on the shoulder of his leather jacket is drawn with an arrow through it and the word 'MOM'. It doesn't look painted on.": "他咧嘴对你笑着，瞳孔眯成了一道竖线，露出几颗黄色的尖牙。他转过身去的时候，你看到他皮夹克肩部的心形图案上画了一支射穿的箭，还写着“妈妈”，但不像是印上去的。",

  "Watch closely": "仔细观察",
  "The crowd laughs, but you don't really hear it. The knife spins in his hand. This time -- either because of the adrenaline or because he's actually moving slower -- you can see the motion of his arm as he throws it. He twists his wrist in an odd way that you don't think he did before.": "观众们在哈哈大笑，但你没怎么听进去。刀子在他指缝中舞蹈。这一次不知是因为你集中精神还是因为他动作缓慢——你竟然看清楚了他投掷刀子时手臂的动作。他的手腕以一个前所未有的奇怪角度扭曲着。",

  "Welp": "嗯",
  "Phew": "呼",
  "Welp. That tears it, doesn't it? It looks like these aren't regular carnies dressed as clowns you're dealing with here.

  "How long have you been in here?": "你呆在这里多久了？",
  "Well, I took care of the clowns and the cows...": "我干掉了那些小丑和牛……",

  "Cows wreck your herb gardens?": "是牛群毁了你的药草园？",
  "Yeah, if you're growing more than about a flowerpot's worth, they get wind of it somehow. They hate the stuff. Can't figure why. Here, I've got a few extra seeds you can have. Be careful with them.": "是的，只要种植超过一花盆的量，它们就会闻风而来。它们很讨厌这玩意，也不知道为啥。喏，我这里有几粒种子可以送给你，当心点牛群。",
  "Three or four days. I'm starving! Cowsbane's poisonous, so I've been chewing on this old leather hat for sustenance.": "三四天了。我快饿死了！因为奶牛克星是有毒的，所以我只能吃这顶旧皮帽果腹。",

  "Sorry, not yet.": "抱歉，还没呢。",
  "As you enter the tannery, the second thing you notice is that the place has been abandoned for years -- probably since The Cows Came Home. A lot of the equipment is wrecked, and all of it is covered with dust.": "你一进入制革厂，就发现这地方早已被遗弃多年——或许自打奶牛归乡之后就这样了。大部分设备都已被毁坏，覆盖在层层尘埃下。",
  "The <i>first</i> thing you notice is that there are a bunch of rodeo clowns in here, fighting with... well, they aren't cows exactly. They're more like the possessed skins of cows.": "<b><color=red>首先</color></b>你看到的是一群牛仔小丑正在跟……一群类似牛的生物战斗。准确的来说是披着牛皮的魔物。",

They're more like the possessed skins of cows.": "<b><color=red>首先</color></b>你看到的是一群打扮成牛仔小丑的家伙正在跟……一群类似牛的生物战斗。准确的来说是披着牛皮的魔物。",
  "That's a little strange, because you've seen people wearing, for example, cow-leather chaps, and you've never seen anyone being attacked by their chaps. Maybe there's something about the tanning process that makes leather impervious to possession, and these cow-ghost-whatevers are untanned hides?": "这情景有点诡异，因为你见过有人披着牛皮套，但从未见过有人被牛皮套袭击的。或许是因为制革过程中的某道程序导致皮革无法被附身，而这些奶牛都是未加工过的皮革？",
  "In any case, the clowns and cows seem preoccupied enough with their fighting that they haven't noticed you -- at least, not yet.": "无论如何，这些小丑和牛正在忙着互相厮杀，暂时没留意到你的出现。",
  "The whole weird situation reminds you of old folk-tales of wars in Hell, between two types of demons -- one side that looked like cows, and the other side that looked like clowns. And apparently, that's why the guys who worked at rodeos dressed up that way, as a reference to those old stories. Is this related? Like maybe some old rodeo clowns decided to take their jobs a little more seriously?": "这个诡异的情况让你联想起古老的寓言——传说在地狱中有两种恶魔常年互相厮杀——一方长得像牛，一方长得像小丑……所以这些牛仔就是故意穿成这样子的？两者之间有何联系？难道说是某些牛仔小丑想让自己的差事看起来更正式一些？",
  "As you approach the clown and weird-cow-leather-ghost-thing, they take notice of you and stop fighting while they process this new development.": "当你靠近小丑和披着牛皮的鬼怪时，他们也注意到你了，因此都停下战斗静观其变。",
  "The clown, fortunately, seems to decide he hates cows more than he hates you. The cow, <i>un</i>fortunately, decides it hates you more.": "幸运的是，相对于你，小丑更憎恨奶牛。<b><color=red>不幸</color></b>的是，奶牛憎恨你更甚于小丑。",
  "Hate it right back [Fight]": "以牙还牙[战斗]",
  "You beat the cow, but the enemy of your enemy is apparently not your friend, because the clown decides it's his turn to be on the right side of the screen.": "你打败了奶牛，但是敌人的敌人并非永远是朋友，因为小丑现在把目标也转移到你身上了。",
  "Uh oh. [Fight]": "啊哦。[战斗]",
  "Well, that's one clown and one cow down. You hear a lot more fighting going on in the rest of the tannery though, so that pat on the back will have to wait 'til later.": "世界又少了一个小丑和一头牛。但是战斗尚未结束，你听见制革厂的其余角落传来了更多的打斗声。",
  "You wake up outside the tannery. It doesn't seem very likely that either the clowns or cows would have taken pity on you and dragged you to safety, so maybe your legs just activated autopilot and ran away as soon as you blacked out?": "你醒来发现自己躺在制革厂外。小丑或奶牛都不大可能会对你网开一面，所以很可能是当你失去意识时你的双腿开启了主角模式自动逃跑出来了？",
  "Good job, legs.": "好样的，我的腿。",
  "This scene has the makings of a real brawl. Not only does one of the clowns have a nasty look in his eye -- nastier than typical, I mean -- but one of the possessed cowhides is stretched on a tanning frame. Which... makes it stronger somehow, I assume?": "这情况杀气重重啊。不仅仅是某个小丑的眼神特别吓人，而且某张被附身的牛皮也展开悬挂在鞣皮架上，这样……能让它变得更强吗？？",
  "Bring on the brawl [Fight]": "战就战[战斗]",
  "Guess what.  The clowns turn on you after the cows are all dead.": "你猜如何。当牛被杀光后，那群小丑就转而出手对付你了。",
  "This is not surprising": "意料之中",
  "Whew, what a mess that fight was. And what a mess the floor is afterward. At least now you're free to poke around the scenery.": "呼，真是乱七八糟的战斗。整个地面也搞得一塌糊涂了。不过你现在至少可以随意搜索这地方了。",
  "You take that nasty clown's knife, and oh look! They also had a key!": "你拿走了那个凶恶小丑的刀子。咦！他们身上还有把钥匙！",
  "You did not prevail.  It's okay.  There were a lot of them, and they were horrible!": "你输了！不过也没事。毕竟对方人多，而且特别吓人！",
  "Yeah": "是啊",
  "Your attempt to sneak up on the cows fails, assuming you were even sneaking and not just moseying over.": "你尝试潜行靠近牛群但失败了，主要是因为你的潜行跟饭后遛弯无异。",
  "The cows appear all too willing to add your face to the list of faces they hate, and turn their attention from the clowns, who jump on this opportunity to get the jump on their ancient enemies.": "牛群似乎对你恨之入骨，所以都放下眼前的小丑不管纷纷冲过来想碾碎你，而小丑也趁机出手对付牛群。",
  "Join the fracas [Fight]": "加入大乱斗[战斗]",
  "True to form, the clowns who were on your side in that fight betray you.": "小丑就是小丑，前一刻还在并肩作战，下一刻就背叛你了。",
  "Damned clowns": "天杀的小丑",
  "It feels kind of strange to be fighting alongside demonic clowns, but I guess war makes strange bedfellows.": "跟恶魔小丑并肩作战似乎有点诡异，但是战争的确可以改变一切，甚至和敌人共度春宵。",
  "Ugh, please ignore the fact that I just used 'demonic clowns' and 'bedfellows' in the same sentence.": "呃，请无视我刚才提到的“恶魔小丑”和“共度春宵”的事。",
  "When they see you, the clowns and cows stop hissing and mooing and posturing at each other.": "小丑们和牛群发现你之后就停下了互相嘶吼和张牙舞爪。",
  "Hey! Who the hell are you?": "喂！来者何人？",
  "Uhh... candygram?": "呃……糖果快报？",
  "MOOOOOOO!": "哞——！",
  "Now's our chance! Get them!": "机会来了！动手！",
  "Uh-oh. [Fight]": "啊哦。[战斗]",
  "Run off": "跑路",
  "As predictable as ever, the clowns turn on you once you've helped them defeat the cows.": "果然不出所料，在你帮小丑们消灭了牛群后，他们就转而出手对付你。",
  "Whew. It's a good thing the clowns hate cows more than they hate humans, or that fight could've gone way worse. Fortunately, it seems pretty unlikely that you'll run into any more animated leather-clad cow skeletons on your adventure.": "呼，幸亏小丑们憎恨牛群甚于憎恨人类，否则就凶多吉少了。还好你接下来的征程不大可能会再次碰见奶牛。",
  "...Right?": "……应该是吧？",
  "Anyway, one of the clowns dropped a map of the region. It has the tannery marked on it, with a route leading to it from a place way up north which is marked with... I guess a circus tent? Which would seem weird but, well, clowns.": "总之某个小丑掉落了一张该地区的地图。上面标记着一处制革厂，而通往此地的道路一路向北延伸到某个……马戏团帐篷？奇怪，又是跟小丑有关的。",
  "A pile of loose boards.": "一堆松脱的木板。",
  "Build a crate [hammer + nails]": "造个箱子[锤子+钉子]",
  "There we go.": "好了。",
  "There's a guy back here hiding behind a barrel. He isn't very good at hiding.": "那个木桶后面躲藏着一个家伙。他的隐藏能力很逊。",
  "This door is locked. Which is probably just as well, considering the ruckus you hear on the other side of it.": "这道门上锁了。也未必不是好事，因为你听见门后传来喧闹声。",
  "This door is locked, but the key you found on that clown looks like it'll probably fit. If you're sure you want to go out there. It sounds like one hell of a fight is happening.": "这道门上锁了，但是你在小丑身上找到的钥匙似乎可以打开它。前提是你确定想要进去的话。因为另一侧似乎有人在大打出手。",
  "Unlock it": "解开门锁",
  "Fortunately, those two are too preoccupied with each other to notice you slipping out the door.": "幸运的是，打斗的双方正在忙着厮杀，没有任何察觉到你的出现。",
  "Exit": "离开",
  "As you make to leave, you can still hear clowns and cows fighting elsewhere in the tannery. Maybe this problem will just sort itself out?": "当你准备离开时，你仍然还能听见制革厂里某处传来小丑和奶牛的打斗声。或许等双方两败俱伤之后问题就自然解决了？",
  "Back to exploring": "离开继续探索",
  "This must be a storage shed. It's locked, but maybe the key you found could open it.": "这一定是个仓库。虽然它上锁了，但你找到的那把钥匙应该可以打开它。",

  "There are three clowns out here, each armed with a nasty-looking knife. One of them is licking his knife, and the sound makes you think maybe he is literally sharpening the blade on his tongue. They are facing down two of the stretched-hide cows, and a monstrous thing that looks like an entire cow skeleton draped in flayed cow skin.": "这里一共有三个小丑，人手一把可怕的刀子。其中一个小丑正在舔刀刃，发出的声音听起来像是在舌头磨刀。他们的对手是两块伸展开来的牛皮，以及一具像是披着牛皮的牛骨架。",

Sneaky little varmints.": "嗯，根据我的计算，我们可以在不太麻烦的情况下把它炸掉。问题是，它需要大量的炸药。十分大的量。我们也备了一些应急，但是一群哥布林把它偷走了。真是卑鄙的小流氓。",

  "A Record of the Events of the Expedition To & Into Shaggy Dog Cave, November 1887": "深入癞狗山洞探险记，1887年11月",
  "As Recorded by Jim Plaquewright": "吉姆·布莱克莱特记录",
  "Having acquired through various and sundry means (a story which is interesting in its own right, but better saved for another time) a map purporting to lead to a large cache of jewels and ingots of precious metals hidden by the infamous highwayman and train robber Black Cole Jr. in the years before The Cows Came Home, I, Jim Plaquewright, along with three compatriots -- these being Nathaniel Wyman, Cyrus Howard, and Douglas Watts -- set out to find Shaggy Dog Cave and the aforementioned treasure.": "在历尽千辛万苦终于得到（这段历险同样有趣，且容日后再表）恶名昭彰的公路劫匪和火车大盗小布莱克·科尔的巨量珠宝和稀有金属矿石的藏宝图后，在下吉姆·布莱克莱特跟三位同伴——纳撒尼尔·怀曼、赛勒斯·霍华德以及道格拉斯·沃茨联手踏上征程，前往癞狗山洞寻找宝藏。",
  "Our equipment and provisions consisted of: one cart, and a horse to pull it; four additional horses to be ridden; two shovels, a spade, and a mining pick; a large coil of rope; one large basket of eggs, as well as an assortment of other trail provisions and cookware; my own collection of blank plaques and engraving tools; one large and shaggy dog; and a buttfor.": "我们的装备和补给品包括：一辆马车、一匹拉车的马、四匹用来骑乘的马；两把铲子、一把铁锹、一把镐子；一大条绳索、一篮鸡蛋、以及各种各样的干粮和餐具；我自己的空白牌框收藏和挖掘工具；一条大癞狗；以及一个保鲜桶。",
  "After traveling for two and a half days to the south and east, we arrived at a small town named Dirtwater, the largest settlement in the vicinity of Shaggy Dog Cave. Leaving the dog to watch the horses, the four of us entered the local saloon, and each ordered a beer -- except Cy, who was satisfied with water.": "在往东南方赶了两天半的路后，我们抵达了一处叫污水镇的小镇，这是离癞狗山洞最近的镇子了。我们让癞狗看管马匹，然后四人一起进了酒馆，除了塞勒斯点了一杯水之外每人都点了酒喝。",
  "The barman provided our drinks as requested, and then withdrew a small wooden box from underneath the bar, asking us if we'd care to witness \"something real interesting\". Considering that we still had quite a few hours left to travel, we politely declined, and asked him if he knew the way to Shaggy Dog Cave. He replied that he had never been there personally, but gave us rough directions, which correlated nicely with the notes on our map.": "酒保送上了饮品，然后从柜台下取出了一个小木盒，问我们是否想见证“非常有趣的事情”。因为还有好几个小时的路程，我们就礼貌地拒绝了，然后顺便向他打听前往癞狗山洞的路。他回应说从未去过那里，但是知道大概的方向，他所说的方向跟我们地图上的笔记吻合。",
  "Upon leaving the saloon, we discovered to our dismay that some unknown villain had tampered with our wagon. Fortunately the only supplies missing were the buttfor and the entire basket of eggs (apart from one that Doug had concealed within a pocket for safe-keeping). We also discovered that the dog had absconded with one of the horses, forcing Nate and Cy -- after a drawing of lots -- to share.": "离开酒馆后，我们发现有混蛋动过了我们的马车。幸亏失窃的只是保鲜桶和那篮鸡蛋（除了其中一粒被道格藏在自己衣袋里的鸡蛋）。我们也发现癞狗跟其中一匹马潜逃了，纳撒和塞勒抽签失败后被迫共用一匹马。",
  "After acquiring a barrel of fresh water for the trip (as well as a replacement buttfor), we headed out into the open desert. The sun shone down mercilessly upon us, though we took small solace in the fact that it would have been far more intolerable had we made this expedition during the summer months, rather than November. In order to pass the time on the trip and resist becoming dazed from the heat and susceptible to desert mirages, we exchanged stories of our youth, which I will not be retelling here for reasons of length.": "在添够一桶饮水之后（作为接下来的路程的水源兼替代保鲜桶），我们往辽阔的沙漠出发了。烈日无情地暴晒着我们，不过我们已经算是幸运了，因为选在十一月而不是夏季进行这段征程。为了在路程中打发时间以及避免被海市蜃楼所迷惑，我们畅谈童年往事谈笑风生了一番。",
  "However, I will relate to you three odd occurrences that happened to us during our trek through the desert. The first was two or three hours out of Dirtwater, when Nate noticed a glint of sunlight upon a metallic object partially buried in the sand. This was revealed to be a brass oil lamp of foreign design and manufacture, which fortuitously still contained a quantity of oil. Deciding this might come in handy, we stashed it in the wagon with our other tools.": "然而不得不提到的是，在穿越沙漠的行程中我们遭遇了三件怪事。首先是刚离开污水镇两三个小时行程后，纳撒看见某样半埋在泥沙中的金属物体所反射的光芒。原来是个异域风格的铜质油灯，里面还存有不少燃油。这工具或许用得上，所以我们就收在马车中。",
  "Our next encounter was with a nomadic goblin tribesman, who we discovered spoke excellent English. It enquired as to our destination, and we replied that we were looking for Shaggy Dog Cave, though we did not disclose the reason for our journey. The goblin confirmed that we were heading on the correct course, and mentioned that he had only a short time earlier witnessed a large and shaggy dog riding a horse in the same direction. We all agreed that this was an unusual sight indeed, and continued on our way.": "第二件怪事是我们碰见了一位会说流利人类语的来自游牧部落的哥布林。它询问我们的目的地，而我们只回答是在寻找癞狗山洞。哥布林确认了我们的行进方向是正确的，并且提到他不久前刚碰见一条大癞狗正在骑着一匹马往同样的方向赶路。我们一致认为这是很古怪的现象，然后继续赶路了。",
  "Some time later we encountered a large adobe hut, occupied by two identical-seeming old men with wild hair and long white beards. They invited us to take shelter from the heat, which we gratefully accepted, and introduced themselves as hermits. This struck me as peculiar given that there were two of them, but I felt it would be rude to question them on that point.": "不久后，我们遇到了一处大型帐篷，里面住着两位长得一模一样的老头，都是留着长发白色长胡子。他们邀请我们进帐篷避避暑，我们乐意接受了。他们自称为隐居者，虽然我很好奇为什么是两人一起隐居，但是没有那么无礼地询问。",
  "One of the hermits confirmed that we were near Shaggy Dog Cave, and the other hermit confirmed that what his brother said was true. They also commented that they had seen a large and shaggy dog riding a horse in that direction. We all agreed that this was an unusual sight indeed. The hermits refreshed our water supply in exchange for our buttfor, and we continued on our way, excited to finally be nearing our goal.": "其中一位隐士确认了我们的确很靠近癞狗山洞了，而另一位隐士则确认了其兄弟所说的是真的。他们也同时提到看见一条大癞狗骑着一匹马往同样的方向赶路。我们一致认为这是很古怪的现象。隐士们给我们补充了水源以换取我们的保鲜桶，然后我们就继续赶路了。",
  "After two more hours, we finally arrived at Shaggy Dog Cave. Carefully keeping our excitement in check, lest we become incautious, we unloaded our equipment and supplies from the wagon and took a brief respite in the cool shade of the cave entrance. To celebrate our arrival, Doug unpocketed and shared the egg he had saved from our basket that had been stolen in Dirtwater. Once we were rested, we decided the time had come to explore the cave.": "两个小时候，我们终于抵达癞狗山洞。我们尽量保持冷静地卸下马车上的装备和补给，然后在阴凉的洞口稍作休息。为了庆祝我们顺利抵达，道格取出唯一一枚鸡蛋分给大家吃。休息完毕后，我们决定该开始探索山洞了。",
  "Discovering that we had neglected to pack torches, lanterns, or any other light source with which to illuminate the cave, we declared that it was indeed fortuitous that Nate had discovered that antique oil lamp during our travels. He gave the brass a quick shine and then lit the wick, and we were relieved to discover that it lit easily and provided a very adequate amount of light.": "我们这时候才察觉忘记准备火炬、油灯之类的光源，因此我们很庆幸之前纳撒找到了那个古董油灯。他擦干净了下油灯然后点燃它，我们很庆幸这个古董油灯轻易被点燃了，而且所提供的光亮还挺充足的呢。",
  "As we headed into the cave, we were further encouraged by the fact that the floor was quite even and easy to traverse, and there were no side-passages which might cause us to become lost. Despite this, I resolved to hang a number of plaques to mark our progress through the cave, and engraved them with the tale of our journey, such that others who discovered the cave after us might be entertained and edified by our story.": "我们开始深入山洞，发现地面很平坦易于步行，而且没有什么分岔路分散我们的注意力。虽然如此，我还是在一路上挂上了不少牌框以作标记，并且在每块牌框上写下了我们这段路程的故事，以让后来人能够分享到我们的经历。",
  "Soon we came to the end of the tunnel. While Nate, Cy, and Doug took turns with the excavation, I completed the last of the afore-mentioned plaques. It was a matter of perhaps an hour before Cy's shovel struck a wooden surface with a hollow noise, and we hauled a traditionally-styled treasure chest out of the hole with great excitement.": "我们很快就来到隧道的末端。当纳撒、塞勒和道格轮流挖掘时，我完成了最后一块牌框。大约一小时后塞勒的铲子戳到了某种木质表面发出咣当一声，而后我们怀着激动的心情从洞里拽出了一个传统风格的宝箱。",
  "The chest was locked with an ancient and rusting iron padlock, which broke easily from a single swing of our pickaxe. We opened the lid slowly, and the flickering light of the antique oil lamp shone brilliantly upon jewels of every color and shining ingots of precious metals, just as promised by the legends of Black Cole Jr. Joyous at our triumph, we loaded the chest into our wagon and began the journey home.": "箱子上有一块锈迹斑斑的旧铁锁，被我们的镐子一下砸开。我们慢慢地推开箱盖，古董油灯的闪烁光芒照耀在亮瞎眼的七彩珠宝和珍贵金属矿石上，果然如传说中的一模一样。我们把宝箱放进马车里开始启程回家。",

  "Mrs. Gun looks hesitant for a moment, then seems to make up her mind. She gives you a stern nod, then follows the others. You turn away, and soon hear a man screaming, but the sound quickly decreases in volume as though he were being pulled a great distance away, and then it's gone entirely.": "冈恩太太的脸上露出一丝犹豫，而后仿佛也下定了决心。她向你坚定地点点头，其他幽灵也纷纷如此。你转身离开，并在不久后听到一个男人的尖叫声，但这声音随着他被幽灵们拖远而迅速降低，最终完全消失了。",

Lucky for me, since I couldn't have inherited the company with him around.

  "Lathe? Hmm.": "车床？唔……",
  "He proceeds to crush you. Something feels wrong, like your cue isn't connecting with the ball properly. The ghost shakes his head at you.": "对局依然是一边倒。你的球杆好像和球不能正常接触。幽灵摇了摇头。",

  "There's <i>math</i> in this? Aw jeez!": "这还涉及到<b><color=red>数学</color></b>了？哎哟我的天……",
  "It's a close match -- you have to consult that geometry book a few times just to work out all the angles.  The game comes down to a fight for the eight-ball, and you manage to barely squeak out the win when the ghost catches an unlucky bounce off the corner of a pocket.": "这场比赛势均力敌——你多次翻阅几何学课本来确认自己的击球角度。最终比赛进入了八球争夺战，而幽灵有一杆不太走运地击中了袋边弹开，从而让你惊险获胜。",

  "Oh, I know, dear. But nobody was using these guest rooms, and there were ghosts hovering around with nowhere to be, and I got to feeling homesick for the little BnB I used to run when I was alive... so I thought Mrs. Gun probably wouldn't mind.": "这我知道啊亲爱的。只不过这些客房都没人用，这里又有好多无处可去的幽灵，我也挺怀念我生前开的那家早餐旅馆……我希望冈恩太太不会介意。",
  "I see. Fair enough.": "我明白了。",
  "What does 'BnB' stand for?": "你这是什么店啊？",
  "Hello again, dear. Anything I can do for you?": "又见面了亲爱的。有何需要？",

  "I found you a new eyeball. [glass eye]": "我给你找了一枚新眼球。[玻璃眼球]",
  "Die! Again! [Fight]": "再死一次吧！[战斗]",
  "Oh, it was such a foolish accident. I had a guest I was suspicious of... a nervous, twitchy little man. I thought he might be mixed up in something bad, and one evening as I was passing by his room I gave in to temptation and peeped in on him through the keyhole.": "哦，这是个愚蠢的意外。之前有一位……神经兮兮的小个子客人。我以为他遭遇了什么坏事情，而当某天晚上我经过他的房间时，忍不住从钥匙孔里偷看了一下。",
  "Did you see anything?": "你有看到什么吗？",
  "Well... only for a moment. He was cleaning a small pistol, and I suppose I must have made a noise, because he suddenly jumped and the gun went off.": "嗯……就一下而已。他当时在清理一把小手枪。我猜我肯定是弄出了什么动静，让他突然一蹦而起，手枪走火了。",
  "And it hit you?": "它打中你了吗？",
  "That's right, straight through the keyhole. That's how I died, in fact.": "是啊，正好打穿了钥匙孔。我就这么死了。",

  "No, I think I paid quite sufficiently for that transgression.": "不，我觉得我为此受到的惩罚已经够重了。",

  "How kind! Thank you very much.": "真是太谢谢你了！",
  "She takes the glass eye from you and puts it in, whereupon it falls through her and onto the floor. She tuts as she picks it up.": "她取过玻璃眼球想塞在自己的眼眶里，结果它直接滑落到了地板上。她把眼球又捡起来，啧啧一声。",
  "Oh dear. It's a little too... physical.": "天。这东西……太实体化了。",

  "That's all right, dear. Just let me know if you find one.": "没事亲爱的。找到的话告诉我就好。",
  "That'll do nicely, thank you.": "这个就行了，谢谢。",
  "She takes the hammer, places the glass eye on her desk, and smashes it with a precise <i>crack!</i>": "她取走锤子，把玻璃眼球放在桌子上，然后<b><color=red>咔嚓！</color></b>一声把它砸碎。",

  "She gives you back the hammer and plucks the ghost of the glass eye from the shattered fragments. After blowing the dust off of it, she tucks it into her eye socket.": "她把锤子还给你，然后从玻璃碎片中取出幽灵眼球。她吹吹上面的灰尘，然后塞进了自己的眼眶。",
  "That fits much better.": "现在感觉好多了。",
  "Does it work?": "效果如何？",
  "Hmm. Well, now that you mention it, no. I can't actually <i>see</i> with it.": "唔，你这么一说，好像不能用啊。我安上它也<b><color=red>看</color></b>不见。",

  "Oh dear, this won't do at all. What a shame!": "哎呀，这完全没用。太遗憾了！",
  "You know... I don't really understand why your eye is still missing.": "这个……我不太理解你没啥还是没有眼睛。",
  "Well, I always assumed...": "我一直觉得……",
  "Well, I always assumed when someone loses an arm or something, it just sticks around as an arm ghost.": "我一直觉得就算有人缺胳膊少腿，他们缺失的身体部件也会变成幽灵留在他们身上。",
  "That's why people say they can feel it itching sometimes, 'cause you've still got an arm there, but it's a ghost. It's even called \"phantom limb syndrome.\"  So logically, if the rest of you becomes a ghost after that, it would hook right back up.": "所以人们常说断肢的地方会感觉痒痒，那是因为你的肢体还在那里，只是变成了幽灵。甚至有个专业术语叫做“幻肢综合症”。所以理论上讲，你已经是个幽灵了，之前的幽灵部位应该也会自然接合才对。",
  "But then... where did my eye go?": "可你这么说的话……我的眼睛去哪了呢？",
  "Maybe it got pushed back inside your head?": "也许是当时被子弹打进你脑袋内部了？",

  "She bends her head forward and continues shaking it. You can almost hear a faint rattling sound, and then a <i>plop</i>.": "她把头向前倾并且不停摇动。你听到一阵丁零当啷的响动，然后<b><color=red>咔哒</color></b>一声。",
  "She straightens back up, blinking, with two eyes.": "她直起身子，眨着自己的两只眼睛。",
  "You did it!": "你成功了！",

  "No problem! Have a nice time in heaven or wherever.": "不客气！好好享受天堂的时光吧。",
  "The ghost gives you a friendly wave and fades out of sight.": "幽灵向你友善地招招手然后逐渐消失。",
  "Well that's that then!": "看来事情解决了！",
  "With a howl of ghostly rage, pent up from years of stolen bathrobes and wet towels left on the floor, she splits into five separate ghosts, each one of them a different color. ...Although I guess you'll have to trust me on that.": "她发出一声幽灵式的的怒吼，从被偷多年的浴袍和地上的湿毛巾挣脱出来，并分裂成五个单独的幽灵，每个颜色还都不一样……这一点你真要相信我。",
  "Uh oh...": "啊哦……",
  "It takes more than five copies of a ghost to defeat you.": "仅凭五个克隆幽灵是无法击败你的。",
  "Those five copies of that woman's ghost chided you but good.": "这群五等分的女幽灵真是让你消受不起。",
  "Yeah, they did": "的确如此",
  "This is the ghost of an orchestra conductor, unless he's a ghost of someone pretending to be an orchestra conductor. Either he's very agitated about something, or he's conducting \"Flight of the Bumblebee\".": "这应该是个管弦乐队指挥的幽灵，除非他是个冒牌货。看他现在这样子，要么是对某件事激动过度，要么就是在指挥演奏《野蜂飞舞》。",
  "Try talking to him": "尝试和他交谈",
  "The ghost conductor is still here, and still flailing his arms to the last part of the 1812 Overture.": "幽灵指挥还在那里，仍然胡乱挥动着手臂在指挥《1812序曲》的最后片段。",
  "Ask him about his death": "问问他怎么死的",
  "Sorry to interrupt, but I can't actually hear the music. What are you conducting?": "不好意思打断下，但我听不到一点音乐啊。你到底在指挥啥？",
  "It is the finale of The Year 1812 Solemn Overture, by Tchaikovsky.": "《1812序曲》的终章，出自柴可夫斯基之手。",
  "Ohh, the 1812 Overture. Sure, that would've been my second guess. Er, is your orchestra, like... double-ghosts? Or something?": "哦，《1812序曲》啊，我就说这么熟呢。呃，你的乐队……只能你自己能看见吗？还是有啥别的情况？",
  "What? ...Ah, I see. No, there is no orchestra. I merely have this piece of music irrevocably lodged in my head. It has been nagging at me incessantly ever since my death.": "什么？……哦我明白了。这里没有管弦乐队。只是这一段曲子刻在我的脑海里挥之不去。自从我死掉之后好像就是这样了。",
  "Hmm. This is just a guess, but: did you die during a performance of the 1812 Overture?": "唔，让我大胆猜想一下：你会不会是在指挥《1812序曲》的时候死掉的？",
  "That is correct, yes. Very astute of you.": "没错。你真机灵。",
  "And the finale of that piece features real actual cannons, right? Is that how you died?": "而这首曲子的终章使用了真实的炮弹轰击对吧？这就是你的死因吗？",
  "If it was my fate to be slain by a piece of music, cannons would have been far preferable to my utterly farcical demise.": "如果我命中注定要被一段乐曲杀死，那我宁愿被炮轰死也不会接受这种可笑至极的死亡。",
  "The Overture requires several cannons, because it is impossible to load a single cannon quickly enough to fire as the score demands. However, the stage we were performing on could not have borne the weight.": "《序曲》需要多门大炮，因为仅靠一门炮肯定是来不及装填跟上乐曲节奏的。然而我们的舞台并不能承受如此重量。",
  "I was not informed of the difficulty until it was far too late to make any changes. It transpired that the stage manager decided it would be sufficient to give a box of bullets to the tuba player.": "我之前完全不知道这其中的难度，直到一切已成定局。有人泄漏消息说舞台经理决定把一盒子弹交给大号的演奏者就足够了。",
  "...You were shot by a tuba?": "……你被大号发射的子弹击中了？",
  "I was shot, as you say, by a tuba.": "如你所言，我被大号射死了。",
  "Wow. No wonder you ended up as a ghost.": "哇。怪不得你阴魂不散呢。",
  "Oh, it isn't the ridiculousness of my death that troubles me, really. Accidents happen, as with any of the performing arts. A colleague of mine was decapitated by an errant cymbal during a performance of Paganini's Violin Concerto No. 1 -- such are the risks we take for our art.": "哦，其实我烦心的并不是这荒谬的死法。演出难免有意外，这我理解。我有个同事在演奏帕格尼尼的《第1小提琴协奏曲》时被钹削掉了脑袋——这就是我们为艺术付出的代价啊。",
  "The problem is that the 1812 Overture's finale is a very dramatic and energetic piece. With this music constantly replaying itself in my head, I have been utterly unable to find any peace.": "问题是《1812序曲》的终章是一段充满戏剧性与张力的乐段。它在我脑海中反复不停地演奏，简直让我不得安宁。",
  "I'll see if I can think of a way to help.": "我会想想有什么办法帮忙的。",

  "You silenced that guy once and for all.": "你让这家伙永远解脱了。",
  "That conductor really put a stop to your movements.": "指挥给你的行动画下了一个休止符。",
  "The rest is silence": "此处无声胜有声。",
  "Well now.  That was nice.": "哎呀呀。真不错。",
  "Soothing!": "真舒服！",
  "This ghost is cramming his face with invisible food. Maybe he's the ghost of an emperor?": "这个幽灵在拼命往嘴里塞看不见的食物。也许他是某个皇帝的幽灵？",
  "This ghost is pretending to cram his face with invisible food. It's weird what people will do for the sake of politeness.": "这个幽灵在假装拼命往嘴里塞看不见的食物。可能他对礼貌的含义有什么误解吧。",

  "What's going on here?": "这里咋回事？",
  "This waiter doesn't know how to make ghost food, so he's just giving me imaginary food and hoping I won't know the difference. I feel kind of bad about dragging him into this mess, so I've been pretending to eat it, to humor him. I'm starving!": "这个服务员不知道怎么烹饪幽灵食物，所以他就给我端来一堆空气食物还以为我分不出区别。我觉得把他搅合进来也怪不好意思的，所以只能假装拼命吃给他一点安慰。其实我都要饿死了！",
  "Huh. You need some actual ghost food? Maybe I can help you out.": "哈，你需要来点真正的幽灵食物吗？也许我能帮上忙。",

  "Did you choke?": "你被枪噎着了？",
  "What? No. It went off and shot me to death.": "啥？不不。枪走火把我打死了。",
  "Why did--": "什么鬼——",
  "Look. All I know is, I need to eat a bowl of gunless chili in order to satisfy my hunger and pass on to the afterlife.": "喂，我知道的就是我要吃一碗不含枪的辣酱来满足我的胃口并顺利前往来生。",

  "Well, without getting too psycho-analytical, these guys were <i>gunfighters.</i> I mean, they counted that as a significant part of their identity. Fighting without guns was not just outside their wheelhouse, they considered it a waste of their time and talents. Like asking a fancy French chef to make you a grilled cheese sandwich.": "这个没什么太值得分析的，毕竟他们都是<b><color=red>枪手</color></b>嘛。他们把这当做是自己身份的重要组成部分。不用枪的战斗不仅仅是学未致用，也是对他们时间和天赋的浪费。这就好比让一位久负盛名的法国大厨给你做个奶酪三明治一样。",
  "Well, a fight breaks out in the heat of the moment, that's one thing. But they cool off enough to schedule a meeting for the next day? And still go through with it? A card game is a heckuva thing to get killed over.": "怒气上头大打出手，这很正常。但他们约在第二天决斗说明还没失去理智对吧？在这种情况下他们还要赴约吗？为了打个扑克犯不上拼命吧。",
  "It's an honor thing, I suppose. That and they were each confident that they wouldn't be the one getting killed. Yes, it's dumb, but it's also extremely immaterial. Toxic definitions of masculinity and the general lawlessness of the frontier are not what's on trial here.": "我认为这事关面子。二人都非常自信地认为自己不会是倒下的那个。这确实挺蠢的，但这也和本案无关。我们要审判的并非是对男子气概的错误理解或是西部普遍的无法无天。",
  "Yes -- high noon.": "是的——正午。",
  "Figures. Why is it always high noon?": "明白了。为啥总是正午呢？",
  "Tradition, I suppose. And since the sun is at its highest in the sky, everything's brightly-lit and there aren't many shadows, so that's good for gunfighting.": "大概是传统吧。日当正午，一切都明亮而炽烈，阴影无处可藏，因此非常适合枪战。",
  "Plus you can go have your duel on your lunch break.": "此外你也可以在午饭之后决斗。",
  "Well, the next day they both showed up shortly before noon and squared off about thirty feet from each other. When noon struck, Macready fired -- fast enough that Timsbury didn't get his shot off, on account of having his head shot off. That's pretty much the long and short of it.": "嗯，第二天双方都在正午前不久出现并相互距离三十英尺站定。正午一到，麦克雷迪率先开火——快到蒂姆斯博瑞没来得及开枪就掉了脑袋。事情的经过就是如此。",
  "I'm gonna have to ask for some more details on that.": "关于这件事我还想问问细节。",
  "I lost track of the story. Can you start over?": "我有些地方没记住，你能从头再说一遍吗？",
  "Hold that thought, I'll be right back.": "先等等，我马上回来。",
  "Okay, let's start from the beginning.": "好吧，我们从头开始。",
  "What weapons were they using?": "他们各自用的什么武器？",
  "He fired exactly at noon?": "他是准时在正午开枪的吗？",
  "You said there were witnesses?": "你说当时有目击者？",
  "Actually... I'm lost. Can we start over?": "其实……我有点晕。从头来一遍好吗？",
  "I need to go think about this for a bit.": "我得好好思考一下。",
  "Macready had a .45 caliber single-action army revolver. Timsbury had an older-model .36 caliber cap-and-ball navy revolver, which he loaded with paper cartridges instead of packing the gunpowder by hand.": "麦克雷迪手持一把.45口径的单发陆军左轮。蒂姆斯博瑞则是一把老式的.36口径撞击点火式海军左轮，他在里面装填的是弹壳纸而非火药子弹。",
  "<i>OBJECTION!</i> Those are significantly different weapons!": "<b><color=red>我反对！</color></b>这完全是不同的武器！",
  "Let me ask you something else.": "让我问些别的。",
  "Are you kidding me? They're both pistols!": "你在逗我吗？两把都是手枪！",
  "A modern cartridge revolver versus an antique cap-and-ball loader? Ridiculous!": "一把现代弹仓式左轮对战一把古董雷管枪？开什么玩笑！",
  "That 'antique' was in production until 1873 and was considered one of the most reliable and popular six-shooters in the territories! Furthermore, the restriction against differing weapons in a duel is about pistols versus <i>rifles</i>, or the proverbial knife in a gunfight! Or, as a more recent example, a <i>nitwit</i> trying to argue the law against a professional attorney!": "你所谓的‘古董’直到1873年前还在生产，并被认为是西部最可靠与流行的六发左轮之一！此外，决斗中对不同武器的限制指的是手枪对战<b><color=red>步枪</color></b>，或者是在枪战中掏刀子！再或者，是一个屁都不懂的<b><color=red>菜鸟</color></b>妄图和专业律师争辩法规条例！",
  "Jeez, that's a bit harsh...": "你这话说的有点过了……",
  "We're done here. Get out!": "到此为止。给我滚蛋！",
  "Yes, as soon as the church bells started ringing.": "没错，以教堂钟声响起为准。",
  "You also mentioned Macready's pocketwatch...": "你还提到麦克雷迪的怀表……",
  "So Macready fired as soon as the church bells struck noon?": "所以麦克雷迪在正午的教堂钟声一响就开火了？",
  "Yes, he had a fancy pocketwatch that chimed on the hour. Is that important for some reason?": "是的，他有一块精致的怀表可以在整点报时。这有什么重要之处吗？",

  "That doesn't make any sense! He didn't shoot early, he shot when the church bells rang! That's verified by witness testimony!": "你在说什么胡话！他并没有早开枪，而是在教堂钟声响起后准时开枪的！目击者的口供都可以证明！",
  "That's not what I'm saying!": "我说的不是这个！",
  "That's not what I'm saying! I'm saying he used the watch to warn him when the church bells were <i>about</i> to ring! A five-second \"get ready\" alert would have given him a huge advantage in reaction time!": "我说的不是这个！我的意思是他在利用怀表来提醒自己教堂钟声<b><color=red>马上</color></b>要响起了！只需要提前五秒钟准备，他就能在反应时间上占尽上风！",
  "Hah! What do you say to <i>that,</i> Counselor?": "哈哈！<b><color=red>这下</color></b>你还怎么说，律师？",
  "You know... I'll give you that one. That's not bad. There's just two problems with that argument.": "这个嘛……我得表扬一下你，说得好。只有两个小问题。",
  "Oh? What?": "哦？什么？",
  "Firstly, you're just <i>guessing.</i> You have no evidence!": "首先，你只是在<b><color=red>猜测</color></b>。你没有证据！",
  "Ah. Well...": "啊，这个……",
  "And secondly, even if Macready was using that trick -- which he may well have been, he was pretty clever -- it wouldn't be illegal!": "其次，就算麦克雷迪真的耍了这个花招——也不是没有可能，毕竟他挺聪明的——也不算是违法的！",
  "<i>Whaaaaaat??</i>": "<b><color=red>啥啥啥？？？</color></b>",
  "There's nothing in duel law prohibiting the use of minor strategies like that! So long as Macready didn't fire before the appointed time, it's all above-board!

  "Hmm. I'll be back, I may need to do some research.": "唔，我回头再来，我要先去做点研究。",
  "He was a gunfighter, through and through. And by that I mean he was an adrenaline addict, and duelling was his needle of choice. Hell, if you told me you had evidence that he cheated at poker with the specific intent of baiting people into challenging him to duels, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. He was a sly one.": "他这人终其一生就是个枪手。我的意思是他非常沉迷于这种刺激感，没事就喜欢找人决斗。如果你说他在扑克中作弊就是为了诱使别人发怒来和他决斗的话我都不奇怪。这家伙很狡猾。",
  "Her expression softens, and she sighs.": "她的眉头舒展开来，然后叹了口气。",
  "I make him sound like a real devil; that's not fair. He was smart, and charming, and could've been a good man... if he'd chosen an entirely different life for himself.": "我是不是把他说的太坏了，其实不然。他既聪明又有魅力，本可以做个好人……倘若他最初能选择一条不同的人生道路的话。",
  "Hmm... well, I recall he had a real good head for numbers. He told me that he never forgot a date, and every man he'd ever killed, he'd remember to pour a beer on their grave on their birthday.": "唔……我记得他的脑瓜在数学方面十分灵光。他说自己从没忘记过任何一个日子，而对于每个被他杀死的人，他都会在其生日当天为其坟墓洒上一杯啤酒。",
  "A nicer birthday present would've been not having killed them in the first place, of course.": "当然如果他一开始没有杀掉这些人的话将会是更好的生日礼物。",
  "Yyyyup.": "是啊。",
  "Assuming he was innocent, why would Macready invoke trial by combat? His case was pretty straightforward -- a duel only worsened his odds.": "假设麦克雷迪是清白的，那他为什么要发起比武审判？这起案件非常直白——决斗只会让他的处境更不利。",
  "I was mighty surprised, let me tell you. The only thing I can figure is, it was his damnfool sense of \"gunfighter's pride\" or something. Like that was the only form of justice he was willing to submit himself to.": "我可以告诉你，我当时也非常惊讶。我唯一能想到的解释就是，这件事完全出自他所谓的“枪手的荣耀”之类的愚蠢想法。就好像只有通过这种方式他才会心甘情愿伏法一样。",
  "Ha, no. I don't know what Reno's like now, but it didn't have a proper courthouse then, and you can't try a murder charge in the Sheriff's front parlor. Macready sat in jail for a couple of weeks, and then they transported him to Frisco. What with one thing and another, the trial didn't start until July 25th.": "哈，不会的。我不知道里诺现在是什么样，但当时那里并没有像样的法庭，你总不能在警长门前杀人吧。麦克雷迪在监狱里待了几周，然后被送到了弗里斯科。审判一拖再拖，最后到7月25日才开始。",
  "Jeez! So much for the right to a speedy trial.": "天呐！过程那么快，准备工作却要这么久。",
  "The wheels grind slow.": "好事多磨，坏事也是。",
  "Well, we held the trial by combat on the 26th, and that was a Friday. They don't execute prisoners on the weekend, so presumably it would've been the following Monday, the 29th.": "嗯，我们在26日举行了比武审判，那天是个周五。一般他们不在周末处决犯人，所以处决时间应该是下个周一，也就是29日。",
  "In the morning?": "在早上吗？",
  "What with setting up the gallows and letting a crowd gather, they usually happened in the afternoon. Around three, typically.": "处决前要先搭建绞架以及让人群聚拢过来，所以行刑时间通常是下午，准确来说是三点左右。",
  "I looked up July 29th in your almanac, and get this -- there was a total eclipse of the sun that day!": "我在你的航海历上查过了7月29日，你猜如何——当天有日全食发生！",

  "Absurd like a fox! I mean, it's a totally ridiculous coincidence, sure, but it happened!": "这一点也不扯！这当然完完全全是个偶然，但它确实发生了！",
  "But Macready couldn't possibly have taken advantage of it, because he'd've been as surprised by it as anyone else. Maybe if he'd had the opportunity to plan it all out, sure, but you'll need a lot more to convince me of that.": "但麦克雷迪不可能有任何机会的，因为他当时肯定也和其他人一样惊讶。他也许是有机会逃跑，但你得拿出更多证据来说服我。",
  "Well... let me ask you something else.": "嗯……让我再问点别的。",
  "Hmmm. I'll be right back.": "唔，我去去就回。",
  "Absurd like a fox! You said yourself that Macready was really good at remembering dates. He could've read about the eclipse at any time and stored that knowledge away for future use, like to give himself an advantage in a duel or something.": "这一点也不扯！你说过麦克雷迪很会记日子。他很可能之前就读过日食的信息以备不时之需，比如让自己在决斗中占得上风之类的。",
  "All right, that's reasonable as far as it goes, but Macready couldn't have worked the eclipse into an escape plan, because he didn't have any say over the court schedule.": "好吧，这听起来还有点道理，但麦克雷并没有办法把日食规划到逃脱计划中，因为他对法庭的时间安排没有任何异议。",
  "You said \"What with one thing and another, the trial didn't start until July 25th.\" Macready could've caused any number of those delays himself -- by faking illness in prison, or messing with the horses on the ride to Frisco, or anything!": "你说过“审判一拖再拖，直到7月25日才开始。”这很可能就是麦克雷迪自己故意拖延的——在狱中假装生病，或者前往弗里斯科的途中让马儿出点问题，什么都有可能！",
  "This also could explain the trial by combat!": "这也能解释比武审判的原因了！",
  "...You mean, there ended up being too much delay, so if a regular trial went on too long and he was found guilty, he'd have missed the eclipse.": "……你的意思是，中途延期太久，因此如果常规审判持续太长时间而他被认定有罪的话，日食也救不了他。",
  "Exactly! Whereas if he called for trial by combat, everything would be resolved one way or the other in only one more day! Maybe you'd win and that'd be fine, but if you lost he could use his escape plan!": "完全正确！倘若他发起比武审判的话，一切只需一两天就能全部完成！如果你赢了那自然最好，但如果你输了他也能靠自己的逃脱计划保住性命！",
  "I have to admit, this is pretty compelling. But it's all maybes and what-ifs. Yeah, maybe it happened, but maybe Macready was rescued by leprechauns!": "我得说你的逻辑很不错，但这仍然还停留在“也许”和“如果”的范畴。对，也许这的确发生了，但也许麦克雷迪是被矮精灵救走的呢！",
  "Oh man! Are there leprechauns in Frisco?": "我的天！弗里斯科有矮精灵吗？",
  "You need some kind of hard evidence before this is any more than just a fun story, is what I mean.": "我的意思是，你说话要讲证据，而不是天马行空信口开河。",
  "How can I find evidence of Macready's escape?": "我要怎么找到麦克雷迪逃脱的证据？",
  "I found a newspaper article!": "我找到了一篇新闻报道！",
  "Any idea where should I start looking for Macready?": "我该从哪开始寻找麦克雷迪的消息呢？",
  "Are you ready for this?": "你准备好了吗？",
  "This is taking WAY too long so I'm just gonna fight you. [Fight]": "这真是没完没了，还是直接开打吧。[战斗]",
  "Hang on, I'll be right back.": "等等，我马上回来。",
  "Well, we don't know that an escape even happened.": "这个嘛，我们连到底有没有逃脱这回事都不知道。",
  "Something like that would've been in the news for certain.": "如果有的话肯定会登报的。",
  "Okay, I'll see what I can find.": "好吧，我去找找看。",
  "I found a newspaper article! The guys scheduled to be executed the day of the eclipse escaped, and one of them was never caught!": "我找到了一篇新闻报道！原定被处决的一批犯人趁着日食逃脱，并且其中一人就此下落不明！",
  "Didn't say, did it?": "没有说吧？",
  "Nope. Dammit.": "没有。见鬼。",
  "And executed criminals aren't given gravestones with their names on them, so you can't just go looking around Frisco Cemetery to find out. Listen, @firstname@, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but at this point you would have to actually find Macready himself to prove he wasn't executed due to my failure.": "而被处决的罪犯墓碑上并没有刻着名字，所以就算你去弗里斯科墓地查证的话也没有意义。@firstname@，我真的很感谢你为此的努力，但你必须找到麦克雷迪本人才能证明他的死与我无关。",
  "Well I guess that's what I'll do then!": "那我知道我该怎么做了！",
  "Your guess is as good as mine. I have to imagine he got as far the heck away from Frisco as he could, though. <i>If</i> he's the one that escaped.": "我也这么想。不过我估计他肯定会尽可能远离弗里斯科，<b><color=red>如果</color></b>他是那个逃脱者的话。",
  "Yeah. Hmmm.": "嗯，对啊。",

  "It was him. I spoke to him personally.": "就是他。我亲自和他交谈过。",
  "She turns the watch around in her hands for a while, just looking at it without saying anything. Then she slowly winds it, and listens as it chimes the hour.": "她一言不发地将怀表放在手里来回把玩。然后她缓缓转动表针，听着它准点报时的声响。",

  "Well, let's see. She married Dan Stapleremover in 1875 -- he was the inventor of the staple remover, did you know that? They'd met at an inventors' convention three years previously. Dan decided to take her last name because he had wanted to call his invention \"office chompers\", and he was always a little annoyed that people called it after him instead. They had three daughters named Dorothy, Blanche, and Rose.": "我们继续。她在1875年嫁给了丹·斯戴普瑞姆弗——他就是起钉器的发明者你知道吧？他们在此前三年的发明者大会上相识。丹决定改为和妻子同姓，因为他想把自己的发明叫做“公文嘎嘣脆”，但他又不喜欢别人这么称呼自己。二人婚后育有三个女儿，分别叫做多萝西，布兰彻与萝丝。",
  "That's nice...": "挺不错啊……",
  "Unfortunately, Dan vanished mysteriously in 1889, shortly after Rose was born. Nobody knows what happened to him, although it's generally assumed he was killed by bandits while he was on the road for Gun Industries business. And then all three of the girls went missing the year after. They went to summer camp, and were just never heard from again. No ransom note or anything! Mrs. Gun was never the same after that, naturally. She started blaming it on ghosts, though as far as I know there's been no ghost activity here until just the other day.": "遗憾的是，在萝丝诞生后不久，丹就于1889年神秘失踪。没有人知道发生了什么，但大家普遍认为他是在处理冈恩工业业务的路上被强盗杀害了。次年，三个女儿也不见了踪影。她们前往夏令营之后便从此杳无音信。甚至没有收到任何赎金要求！自打这之后，冈恩太太也像变了个人似的。她开始把这些事怪罪于幽灵作祟的头上，但就我所知直到昨天之前这里从来没有发生过闹鬼事件。",
  "Isn't it amazing? Mrs. Gun had it built in the mid-to-late 70s when she and her husband decided to start a family -- it was finished in 1877.
